# event-key-codes

Welcome to event-key-codes mini-project! This project demonstrates how to capture keyboard keypress events and display the corresponding `event.key` and `event.code` values. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help you understand keyboard interactions in web applications.

## Features

- Real-time capture of keyboard keypress events.
- Displays the pressed key's `event.key` and `event.code` values.
- Educational tool to learn about keyboard events in web development.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

4. Press keys on your keyboard to see the corresponding `event.key` and `event.code` values displayed on the page.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance and styling of the capture display by modifying the CSS file (`styles.css`). The JavaScript code (`script.js`) handles the keyboard event capture and display logic.

Feel free to expand on this project by incorporating additional functionality, such as tracking key combinations or implementing different UI interactions based on specific key presses.
