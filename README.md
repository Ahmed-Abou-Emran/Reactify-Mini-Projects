# Reactify-Mini-Projects

Welcome to the Reactify-Mini-Projects repository! This collection of mini projects is designed to help you revisit and enhance your skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and React. By working through these projects, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how React simplifies the development process and enables you to create dynamic, interactive, and efficient web applications.

## Project List

<!-- example -->

1. [Simple To-Do App](./simple-todo-app/): Create a basic to-do list application using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Then, reimplement the same functionality using React components to appreciate the differences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory of your chosen mini project.
3. Follow the instructions in the README of each project to set up and run the project.
4. Implement the project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as specified.
5. Once you're comfortable with the vanilla implementation, revisit the project and reimplement it using React.
6. Compare and appreciate the differences in code structure, modularity, and ease of development between the vanilla and React versions.
